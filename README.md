# Predicting Concrete Strength with Machine Learning  

## 📄 Overview  
Concrete strength is a critical factor in construction, and understanding its compressive strength ensures structural integrity. This repository demonstrates how to leverage machine learning techniques to predict concrete compressive strength based on various mix proportions and environmental factors.
